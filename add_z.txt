 opened for 'w'

do you want to use any of the analysis routines
Input  '0' to exit
Input  '1' to combine track data sets, analyse and display.          
Input  '2' to display only existing statistical analyses             
Input  '3' to compute time average, varience and                     
           filtered varience fields, note this can also              
           be done as part of the feature identification.            
Input  '4' to perform spectral filtering of fields by,               
           spherical harmonic decomposition.                         
Input  '5' to perform a time domain filtering of fields using        
           a Lanczos filter.                                         
Input  '6' to perform a spectral domain (time) filtering of fields.  
Input  '7' to convert data to standard binary format with            
           header.                                                   
Input  '8' to extract fields from a file at chosen sampling,         
           fill missing data holes by simple interpolation,          
           apply mathematical transformation and convert to          
           binary format.                                            
Input  '9' to perform field smoothing using B-splines.               
Input '10' to combine weighted time analysis fields from option '3'  
           seperate files for each period.                           
Input '11' to combine weighted time analysis fields from option '3'  
           single file for all periods.                              
Input '12' to compute vorticty, EKE or wind speed from wind fields.  
Input '13' to compute gradient fields and thermal front parameter.   
Input '14' to interpolate data to a new grid using B-splines.
